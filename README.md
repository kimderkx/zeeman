#### MASTER branch
Contains basic HTML and CSS elements.

#### ADDED-SMARTY-CODE branch
Same HTML and CSS elements, but with smarty code. Smarty is a template engine for PHP. ESP I wrote this in is Clang.
Having Smarty code setup in the template allows you to create, fill and edit emails with a WYSIWYG editor. No code needed.
